-----------------------------
## Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
The model with better results over time is the closing price predictor.

-----------------------------
## Which window size works best for the model?
Having a window size of 1 in both models the prediction follows morw closly, however using a window of 10 smooths the predicted prices out.
